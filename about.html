            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        
        LG Cleaning Services is a family run business, founded in October 2023.<br>
        
        <p>Our company was first started to support the continuous running of my brother’s Air bnb’s as they were finding it difficult to find consistent and good cleaners.
        
        I started cleaning for my brothers in April 2023 to allow them time to find a cleaning company that is trustworthy, dependable and has the same values as they do.
        
        After a few months of cleaning my brothers Air bnb’s, their reviews got better and bookings increased by 40% in the first 3 months of me cleaning.
        
        Word got around in one of the apartment buildings about a new cleaner, as I was seen entering and exiting the building with cleaning equipment on a regular basis and we subsequently gained new clients.
        
        We then made a conscious decision to turn what was initially an intermittent cleaning service to support my brothers business’, to a family run business providing a great service to all.</p>
